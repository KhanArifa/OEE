# OEE
Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), which includes machine availability, performance, and quality measures, has become a crucial Key Performance Indicator (KPI) in the quest for manufacturing excellence.We carefully examine each algorithm’s performance using met- rics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and model comparisons using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), creating a comprehensive picture of each algorithm’s strength
